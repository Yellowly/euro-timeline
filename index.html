                                            Jemzo Ravizza is born into an extremely wealthy catholic Italian merchant family. His family has traded throughout the Mediterranean sea since the rise of the merchant class in Italy, and with the growth of the printing press, publishes books about Mediterranean geography and trade. His family’s trade also fuels Jemzo’s love of foreign goods, mostly food, throughout his childhood.

                                            Early on, Jemzo’s family hires people to teach their son to read and write. As he gains knowledge, Jemzo begins to study world geography and trade, both through his family’s books and hired teachers. Around this time, his family will also provide patronage to artists, commissioning religious paintings and sculptures to decorate their house with, along with occasional paintings of themselves or their ships. Jemzo’s continued fascination with foreign foods leads to his request for a painting of a tomato, which was admired for its beauty at the time, though never eaten.

                                            Following the disaster of the Italian Wars and general decline of Italy in contrast to the success of Spain and new world trade, Jemzo decides to move to Spain to join in on the vast influx of wealth. While still young, Jemzo is supported by his family and their wealth, soon making his first trip to the New World. His family’s wealth and continued influx of new world gold allows Jemzo to purchase a few more ships, further increasing his income.

Jemzo continues his pursuit of foreign foods, dedicating some of his resources into bringing back new foods and spices from Asia in addition to the Americas. While still well-off, Jemzo vaguely notices that the amount he can buy seems to decrease with every new haul of New World gold.

                                            The growth of Jemzo’s business empire is hindered by the continued devaluation of his imported gold. In addition, pirate attacks, most notoriously the English privateer Francis Drake, both halts imports and requires many ship repairs. While Jemzo is unable to secure protection from attacks, his foreign food and spice imports continue to be successful, as Jemzo realizes that the gold he can get from these goods seemingly increased out of nowhere.

Jemzo retires to a farm in southern Italy, taking a small portion of all the crops he managed to collect, and distributes most of his wealth and possessions to other members of his family.

                                            In Italy, Jemzo grows foreign commodities, most notablebly potatoes, corn, and tomatoes, which become viewed as luxury items by locals in his area, though still not integrated into many real meals. Jemzo himself enjoys a moderate lifestyle, eating potatoes and corn despite their low yield at the time, along with purchased meats with his preserved spices. One day, Jemzo cannot resist the temptation of trying a tomato, despite fears by others that they were poisonous. He eats with gusto off a cheap metal plate he brought back from Spain. A few days later, Jemzo dies of lead poisoning.
